                By connecting various tools your agile training company uses daily - website, mailing software,
                invoicing systems - Workshop Butler creates a continuous flow of data from one tool to another and saves
                tens of hours by automating manual tasks.

                invoicing software or CRM. For example, you can automatically create invoices on each attendee

                I don't have to worry about all administration Workshop Butler is dealing with. It’s there, it works, it
                runs itself, it markets itself. I don’t even need to do anything or think about it which is awesome.
